# weatherapp

Simple iOS app to display current temperature in a city or zip code. Uses the openweathermap API (http://openweathermap.org).

To use:
- Download the source code and run in XCode
- Search a city and choose one from the list OR manually enter a zip code and tap "search"

Planned for next release:
- More weather detail / better UI
- Detect device GPS location and search based on device GPS
- Remembering saved searches
- Localization
